        size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">GeoConstructor is an object-oriented software
        interface for creation of your own GIS applications in Microsoft Windows environment.
        GeoConstructor has been designed in standards such as Visual Basic Custom Control (VBX)
        and ActiveX (OCX). GeoConstructor is distrubuted together with GeoDraw/GeoGraph and is
        intended for wide set of GIS users which want to create their own GIS applications.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">The main functionalities of GeoConstructor
        :</font><ul>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Free selection of a programming environment.
            It is not necessary to study any new programming language because VBX/OCX protocols are
            supported by the most part of modern visual programming tools such as Microsoft Visual
            Basic, Visual C++, Borland C++, Borland Delphi.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Creation of GIS applications working with
            different spatial data formats. GeoConstructor includes a built-in concept of
            &quot;spatial formats drivers&quot; - besides the internal formats, it strightly works
            with also ArcView ESRI shape file, DX-90 etc.and potentially any described vector format,
            as well as about 50 different raster data formats. All we need to add a new format - to
            add a driver for such a format without internal changes in a program code. Additionally
            via import/export fuctions of GeoDraw you can access data to other different formats
            (GENERATE Arc/INFO, MIF/MID MapInfo, DXF AutoCAD, VEC IDRISI etc.) and make the required
            operations with the spatial data. </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">It is possible to create GIS applications
            working with databases in dBase, Paradox, Access, MS SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase,
            Interbase, Informis etc. formats by using ODBC or IDAPI drivers provided with Microsoft
            Visual Basic, Visual C++ or Delphi. So GeoCosntructor provides you an access to many
            spatial and attribute data formats.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Thematic mapping.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Import of map compositions created in
            GeoGraph.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Editing of non-topological (cosmetic)
            spatial layers , including multi-user editing mode, is supported.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Editing of vertices of arcs and polygons,
            boundary modifications, standard operaations with Windows exchange buffer.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Tools for managing of a map composition.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Built-in tools for display map and access to
            spatial objects including their coordinates.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Wide set of opportunities for selection and
            filtration of spatial objects</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Support of a wide set of map projections.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Dynamic overlay of vector layers to find an
            interesting areas in multi-layer structure.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">In practice it is enough several days for
        programmers to start writing GIS applications by use of GeoConstructor. It is possible to
        implement many functions which are not available in GeoGraph. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">GeoConstructor works in Microsoft Windows
        95 and NT environments.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Samples of projects designed by use of
        GeoConstructor : </font><ul>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">system of monitoring and managing of cars of
            Moscow city 911 emergency service (using navigation system with GPS and radio-modems and a
            map of Moscow) </font></li>
          <li><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">GIS / Hypertext system of Krasnoyarsk city
            distributed on CDs (Krasnoyarsk is a central city of Easteern Siberia with population
            about 1 mln.; there were published 5000 CDs; price of CD with GIS software, digital map
            and database is so little as 3US$ per 1 CD );</font></li>

        <p><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Arial">Price - GeoConstructor is included in
        GeoGraph set as a free of charge part of it. So the price of GeoGraph / GeoConstructor is
        US$500. Our basic politics in the software pricing is to help you to save your money for
        the projects and technologies. </font></td>
