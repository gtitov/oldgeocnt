    management<br>
    </b>In this field GIS are used by the Federal auto road service, by regional road
    committees as well some project, education and research institutes .<br>
    In field of auto roads from 1994 the popular direction was to create GIS as the updated
    digital map of roads of the region linked to the attribute database of road passports. As
    the result the existing disorder in the road passport databases was discovered by use of
    GIS and the required changes of data quality were done. Essentially that sometimes finally
    such a work cost nothing for road committees – the road map was published from GIS and
    the profit from the selling of this map fully covered all expenses for GIS creation ! By
    such a way auto road GIS were created by our GIS software more than in 10 regions. The
    layer of such updated roads and linked database was used as a part of regional GIS
    infrastructure. </font></li>

  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080">The growing direction in
    1998-1999 is to integrate the road GIS with field survey data during road inventory,
    linking it with land cadastral system as well as road projecting and constructing. The
    sample of integration of field survey digital coordinate data by using real time (RTK) GPS
    into our GIS GeoDraw / GeoGraph see here.</font></p>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080">In field of railroads GIS are used by
    regional railroads. They are also use GeoConstructor for writing their own applications.<br>
    Our GIS software is also used for monitoring of transport vehicles. As the example see the
    picture from GIS application designed by Moscow city emergency service 911 on
    GeoConstructor (working from 1996). In Moscow city (about 10 mln. population) 911 has
    about 300 cars moving along the city and having radio modems and simple GPS. On the
    central station the situation is managed by use of GIS application displaying the current
    position and the state parameters of each car.</font></li>
