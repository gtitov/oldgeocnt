    </b>Russia is one of the most reach countries in the world in aspect of mineral resources
    (gas, oil, coal, iron and other metals, gold, diamonds etc.) and has a developed structure
    of geological organizations. The Russian Ministry of Natural Resources is the main
    organizations responsible for geological data. It includes the Main Computing and
    Scientific Center (GlavNIVC), the network of regional computing centers along the country
    as well as computing labs and groups in geological committees and geological funds in each
    region (subject of Russian Federation) and up to the many geological expeditions. <br>
    From the beginning of 1990 this system is actively implementing GIS and now it is the
    mostly developed vertical information system using GIS in Russia. The system is developed
    in close cooperation with USGS. The core part of the system is based on several hundreds
    ESRI products (ARC/INFO for SUN and partly for PC, ArcView and other products) and as the
    complementary GIS product all centers use our software GeoDraw / GeoGraph / GeoConstructor
    (more than 600 installations). The complementary GIS products are selected on the base of
    competition between many products and by tests and orders from the regional organizations.
    This wide experience has proved that such a combination of GIS products is valid and
    effective from the point of view of the cost, data exchange and functional capabilities
    and from many other sides.<br>
    Besides the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources, GIS are actively used in many
    governmental and joint stock oil and gas companies. Often you can meet there the same
    combination of GIS software products as well as sometimes MapInfo. <br>
    We help them to create geological database as a part of regional GIS infrastructure.</font></li>
