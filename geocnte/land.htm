    </b>Land cadastral system is a developing direction in Russia due to the implementation
    the new relations like “private property for immobility”, “land rent” and “land
    ownership and property” as one of the most important parts of transaction to the market
    economy from 1992.<br>
    Our GIS software is used by many regional and land committees for creation of cadastral
    maps and use it as GIS subsystem of cadastral document system. The special subjects are
    GIS/GPS intergration and help to design land cadastral systems as a part of regional and
    municipal GIS infrastructure, as well as the interaction between information systems of
    land committees and other services on the same territory. <br>
    Our GIS software is also certified by the responsible Federal state center for use for
    cadastral maps.<br>
    Head of GIS Research Center IGRAS Dr.Kazantsev is an official advisor of deputy chairman
    of the Russian State Land Committee in GIS.</font></li>
