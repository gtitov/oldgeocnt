    </b>In Russia all forest and planning activity are based on Federal Forest Service, Forest
    project enterprises and expeditions (one enterprise per a large region combined from many
    subjects of Russian Federation – about 10), Forest committees (one per each subject of
    Russian Federation - 89) and forest service enterprises (about 30-50 per each subject of
    Russian Federation - total number more than 2000). Our GIS software is used (started from
    1993) by many Forest project enterprises covering more than 5 mln.sq.km – North of
    European part, Middle Volga river, East Siberia and Far East – see the map. These
    enterprises are the basic regional centers for the propagation of GIS forest databases,
    software and technologies into the regions up to the level of forest service enterprises.
    Forest project enterprises create the new forest GIS database for each forest service
    enterprise each 10 years and put the database for the current update to them. So the
    process of GIS penetration to the forest service enterprises started in 1995 and is
    growing now. Our GIS software is also used in Forest Academies in Sankt-Petersburg and
    Ekaterinburg as the education tool as well as in some forest Research Institutes for
    research. <br>
    We help to organize the process of forest project GIS database design so that the regional
    GIS infrastructure is used as much as possible and the results are represented as the
    layers and attribute database in the same regional GIS infrastructure (new forest layer of
    digital topographic maps, available for road planners, pipeline companies etc.). The
    current update of the forest data in forest service enterprises logically looks like the
    update of this part of regional GIS infrastructure (besides forest needs itself). This is
    the way to use GIS as, first of all, unique tool for integration of data, permanently
    created by different organizations of the same territory. </font></li>
