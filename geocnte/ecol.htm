    </b>In field of ecology GIS are used by the Federal Center of Geoecological systems of the
    Russian Ministry of Ecology, by regional and municipal ecological committees, by
    administrations of natural reserves and parks, by state, municipal and private project
    ecological firms, as well as by respective faculties of universities and research
    institutes. All mentioned types of organizations use our GIS software GeoDraw / GeoGraph /
    GeoConstructor for GIS database creation, support and for environmental management. The
    use of data created by many other organizations is the special feature of ecological
    activity. Therefore the use of regional and municipal GIS infrastructure is very important
    in this field. The example of GIS applications like “overlay on fly” see on the map
    picture (overlay of pollution zones by different components). You need only select the
    layers to overlay and apply a query (spatial, QBE, SQL query) and the results as a
    critical zones will be immediately displayed and reported. </font></li>
