<p>Land cadastral system is a developing direction in Russia due to the implementation 
  the new relations like &quot;private property for immobility&quot;, &quot;land 
  rent&quot; and &quot;land ownership and property&quot; as one of the most important 
  parts of transaction to the market economy from 1992.<br>
  Our GIS software is used by many regional and land committees for creation of 
  cadastral maps and as GIS subsystem of cadastral document system. The special 
  subjects are GIS/GPS integration and help to design land cadastral systems as 
  a part of regional and municipal GIS infrastructure, as well as the interaction 
  between information systems of land committees and other services on the same 
  territory. Our GIS software is also certified by the Federal state land center 
  for use for cadastral mapping.<br>
