<p><font size="3">Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences was 
  founded in 1918. The Institute is the leading geographical center in Russia 
  and well known among the worldwide geographical centers.<br>
  The Institute was one of the pioneers in GIS development and implementation 
  in Russia. The Institute's GIS activity was started in 1980ths, including collaboration 
  with ESRI, IDRISI, Spans Tydac as well as the development of our native GIS 
  software. The Institute had created the first GIS joint venture with ESRI to 
  propagate ESRI products in Russia in early 199ths. <br>
  GIS Research Center was established in 1992 on the base of laboratory of cartography 
  of the Institute.</font>

<p>Since 1992 we develop our own GIS software GeoDraw/GeoGraph/GeoConstructor. 
  There are more than 3000 installations of this GIS software over the Russia 
  and abroad. We have an experience to work with ESRI products from 1990, with 
  MapInfo from 1992, with Intergraph from 1992, with IDRISI from 1988, with AutoCAD 
  from 1980ths, i.e. we know different GIS and related products for a long time. 
  We have an experience of making projects inside them, study their development 
  trends, regularly work for data exchange between them and our products.</p>
