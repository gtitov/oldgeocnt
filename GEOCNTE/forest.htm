  <font face="Arial" size="2">In Russia all forest and planning activity are based 
  on Federal Forest Service, Forest project enterprises and expeditions (one enterprise 
  per a large region combined from many subjects of Russian Federation - about 
  10), Forest committees (one per each subject of Russian Federation - 89) and 
  forest service enterprises (about 30-50 per each subject of Russian Federation 
  - total number more than 2000). Our GIS software is used (started from 1993) 
  by many Forest project enterprises covering more than 5 mln.sq.km - North of 
  European part, Middle Volga river, East Siberia and Far East - see the map. 
  These enterprises are the basic regional centers for the propagation of GIS 
  forest databases, software and technologies into the regions up to the level 
  of forest service enterprises. Forest project enterprises create the new forest 
  GIS database for each forest service enterprise each 10 years and put the database 
  for the current update to them. So the process of GIS penetration to the forest 
  service enterprises started in 1995 and is growing now. Our GIS software is 
  also used in Forest Academies in Sankt-Petersburg and Ekaterinburg as the education 
  tool as well as in some forest Research Institutes for research. </font></p>

<p>We help to organize the process of forest project GIS database design so that 
  the regional GIS infrastructure is used as much as possible and the results 
  are represented as the layers and attribute database in the same regional GIS 
  infrastructure (new forest layer of digital topographic maps, available for 
  road planners, pipeline companies etc.). The current update of the forest data 
  in forest service enterprises logically looks like the update of this part of 
  regional GIS infrastructure (besides forest needs itself). This is the way to 
  use GIS as, first of all, unique tool for integration of data, permanently created 
  by different organizations of the same territory.</p>
