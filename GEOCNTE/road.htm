  GeoConstructor-based GIS application is used since 1996 by Moscow city 911 emergency 
  service for monitoring of the service vehicles. 911 has about 300 cars moving 
  along the city and having radio modems and simple GPS. On the central station 
  the situation is managed by use of GIS application displaying the current position 
  and the parameters of each vehicle in action. <br>

  </b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">In this field GIS are used by the Federal 
  auto road service, by regional road committees as well some project, education 
  and research institutes .<br>
  In field of auto roads from 1994 the popular direction was to create GIS as 
  the updated digital map of roads of the region linked to the attribute database 
  of road passports. As the result the existing disorder in the road passport 
  databases was discovered by use of GIS and the required changes of data quality 
  were done. Essentially that sometimes finally such a work cost nothing for road 
  committees – the road map was published from GIS and the profit from the selling 
  of this map fully covered all expenses for GIS creation ! By such a way auto 
  road GIS were created by our GIS software more than in 10 regions. The layer 
  of such updated roads and linked database was used as a part of regional GIS 
  infrastructure. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The growing direction in 1998-1999 
      is to integrate the road GIS with field survey data during road inventory, 
      linking it with land cadastral system as well as road projecting and constructing. 
      The sample of integration of field survey digital coordinate data by using 
      real time (RTK) GPS into our GIS GeoDraw / GeoGraph see here.</font></p>
