<p>Our GIS software is used for oil transportation system from Russia to Europe 
  through Belorussia (the main way of oil export from Russia), for gas pipeline 
  diagnostics and repairing, for emergency management on communications.<br>

<p><b><font color="#000099">GIS for geology, oil and gas industry</font></b> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000080"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Russia 
  is one of the most reach countries in the world in aspect of mineral resources 
  (gas, oil, coal, iron and other metals, gold, diamonds etc.) and has a developed 
  structure of geological organizations. The Russian Ministry of Natural Resources 
  is the main organizations responsible for geological data. It includes the Main 
  Computing and Scientific Center (GlavNIVC), the network of regional computing 
  centers along the country as well as computing labs and groups in geological 
  committees and geological funds in each region (subject of Russian Federation) 
  and up to the many geological expeditions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the beginning of 1990 this system is actively 
  implementing GIS and now it is the mostly developed vertical information system 
  using GIS in Russia. The system is developed in close cooperation with USGS. 
  The core part of the system is based on several hundreds ESRI products (ARC/INFO 
  for SUN and partly for PC, ArcView and other products) and as the complementary 
  GIS product all centers use our software GeoDraw / GeoGraph / GeoConstructor 
  (more than 600 installations). The complementary GIS products are selected on 
  the base of competition between many products and by tests and orders from the 
  regional organizations. This wide experience has proved that such a combination 
  of GIS products is valid and effective from the point of view of the cost, data 
  exchange and functional capabilities and from many other sides.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Besides the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources, 
  GIS are actively used in many governmental and joint stock oil and gas companies. 
  Often you can meet there the same combination of GIS software products as well 
  as sometimes MapInfo. We help them to create geological database as a part of 
  regional GIS infrastructure.</font></p>
