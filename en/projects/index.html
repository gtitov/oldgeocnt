    <b>GIS for INTERNET/INTRANET solutions.</b><br>
    GeoConstructor-WEB-based GIS applications are used by the most popular 
    INTERNET servers and companies in Russia with large number of visitors 
    (up to 3 millions visitors per day) and industrially tested for reliability.

    <b>GIS for forest planning and management.</b><br>

    <p>
    In Russia all forest and planning activity are based on Federal Forest Service, Forest project 
    enterprises and expeditions (one enterprise per a large region combined from 
    many subjects of Russian Federation - about 10), Forest committees (one per each 
    subject of Russian Federation - 89) and forest service enterprises (about 30-50 
    per each subject of Russian Federation - total number more than 2000). Our GIS 
    software is used (started from 1993) by many Forest project enterprises covering 
    more than 5 mln.sq.km - North of European part, Middle Volga river, East Siberia 
    and Far East - see the map. These enterprises are the basic regional centers for 
    the propagation of GIS forest databases, software and technologies into the 
    regions up to the level of forest service enterprises. Forest project 
    enterprises create the new forest GIS database for each forest service 
    enterprise each 10 years and put the database for the current update to them. So 
    the process of GIS penetration to the forest service enterprises started in 1995 
    and is growing now. Our GIS software is also used in Forest Academies in 
    Sankt-Petersburg and Ekaterinburg as the education tool as well as in some 
    forest Research Institutes for research.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/les.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225"><p>
    <p>We help to organize the process of forest project GIS database design so that 
    the regional GIS infrastructure is used as much as possible and the results are 
    represented as the layers and attribute database in the same regional GIS 
    infrastructure (new forest layer of digital topographic maps, available for road 
    planners, pipeline companies etc.). The current update of the forest data in 
    forest service enterprises logically looks like the update of this part of 
    regional GIS infrastructure (besides forest needs itself). This is the way to 
    use GIS as, first of all, unique tool for integration of data, permanently 
    created by different organizations of the same territory.</p>

    <b>GIS for geology, oil and gas industry.</b><br>
    <p>Russia is one of the most reach countries in the world in aspect of mineral resources 
    (gas, oil, coal, iron and other metals, gold, diamonds etc.) and has a developed 
    structure of geological organizations. The Russian Ministry of Natural Resources 
    is the main organizations responsible for geological data. It includes the Main 
    Computing and Scientific Center (GlavNIVC), the network of regional computing 
    centers along the country as well as computing labs and groups in geological 
    committees and geological funds in each region (subject of Russian Federation) 
    and up to the many geological expeditions.</p>
    <p>From the beginning of 1990 this system is actively 
    implementing GIS and now it is the mostly developed vertical information system 
    using GIS in Russia. The system is developed in close cooperation with USGS. The 
    core part of the system is based on several hundreds ESRI products (ARC/INFO for 
    SUN and partly for PC, ArcView and other products) and as the complementary GIS 
    product all centers use our software GeoDraw / GeoGraph / GeoConstructor (more 
    than 600 installations). The complementary GIS products are selected on the base 
    of competition between many products and by tests and orders from the regional 
    organizations. This wide experience has proved that such a combination of GIS 
    products is valid and effective from the point of view of the cost, data 
    exchange and functional capabilities and from many other sides.</p>
    <p>Besides the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources, 
    GIS are actively used in many governmental and joint stock oil and gas 
    companies. Often you can meet there the same combination of GIS software 
    products as well as sometimes MapInfo. We help them to create geological 
    database as a part of regional GIS infrastructure.</p></li>

    <b>GIS for oil and gas transportation.</b><br>
    <p>Our GIS software is used for oil transportation system from Russia to Europe 
    through Belorussia (the main way of oil export from Russia), for gas pipeline 
    diagnostics and repairing, for emergency management on communications.</p></li>
  <li><a name="bm5"></a>
    <b>GIS for ecological management.</b><br>
    <p>In field of ecology GIS are used by the Federal Center of Geoecological systems of the 
    Russian Ministry of Ecology, by regional and municipal ecological committees, by 
    administrations of natural reserves and parks, by state, municipal and private 
    project ecological firms, as well as by respective faculties of universities and 
    research institutes. All mentioned types of organizations use our GIS software 
    GeoDraw / GeoGraph / GeoConstructor for GIS database creation, support and for 
    environmental management. The use of data created by many other organizations is 
    the special feature of ecological activity. Therefore the use of regional and 
    municipal GIS infrastructure is very important in this field. The example of GIS 
    applications like &quot;overlay on fly&quot; is presented on the picture (overlay of 
    pollution zones by different components). You need only select the layers to 
    overlay and apply a query (spatial, QBE, SQL query) and the results as a 
    critical zones will be immediately displayed and reported.</p>

    <b>GIS for emergency services.</b><br>
    <p>Our GeoConstructor-based GIS application is used since 1996 by Moscow city 911 
    emergency service for monitoring of the service vehicles. 911 has about 300 cars 
    moving along the city and having radio modems and simple GPS. On the central 
    station the situation is managed by use of GIS application displaying the 
    current position and the parameters of each vehicle in action.</p></li>

    <b>GIS for road and transport planning and management.</b><br>

    <p>In this field GIS are used by the Federal auto road 
    service, by regional road committees as well some project, education and 
    research institutes.<br>
    In field of auto roads from 1994 the popular direction 
    was to create GIS as the updated digital map of roads of the region linked to 
    the attribute database of road passports. As the result the existing disorder in 
    the road passport databases was discovered by use of GIS and the required 
    changes of data quality were done. Essentially that sometimes finally such a 
    work cost nothing for road committees ÔøΩ the road map was published from GIS and 
    the profit from the selling of this map fully covered all expenses for GIS 
    creation! By such a way auto road GIS were created by our GIS software more 
    than in 10 regions. The layer of such updated roads and linked database was used 
    as a part of regional GIS infrastructure.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/road.jpg" WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="165"></p>
    <ul type="disc"><li>
      <p>The growing direction in 1998-1999 is to 
         integrate the road GIS with field survey data during road inventory, linking it 
         with land cadastral system as well as road projecting and constructing. The 
         sample of integration of field survey digital coordinate data by using real time 
         (RTK) GPS into our GIS GeoDraw / GeoGraph see here.</p></li></ul>

    <b>GIS for land management.</b><br>
    <p>Land cadastral system is a developing direction in Russia due to the 
    implementation the new relations like &quot;private property for immobility&quot;, &quot;land 
    rent&quot; and &quot;land ownership and property&quot; as one of the most important parts of 
    transaction to the market economy from 1992.<br>Our GIS software is used by many 
    regional and land committees for creation of cadastral maps and as GIS subsystem 
    of cadastral document system. The special subjects are GIS/GPS integration and 
    help to design land cadastral systems as a part of regional and municipal GIS 
    infrastructure, as well as the interaction between information systems of land 
    committees and other services on the same territory. Our GIS software is also 
    certified by the Federal state land center for use for cadastral 
    mapping.</p></li>
  <li><a name="bm9"></a>

    <b>GIS for utility management.</b><br>
    <p>Our GIS software is actively used by many organizations working in projection, 
    constructing, repairing and using of networks such as electricity, gas, water, 
    hot water supply in Moscow, Podolsk, Krasnoyarsk, Murmansk, Novokuznetsk etc, as 
    well gas and oil pipelines.<br>Especially interest is the project of Moscow city 
    devoted to technology of interaction between information systems of gas, 
    electricity, water supply services and companies with city GIS infrastructure on 
    project, construction and exploiting stages.</p>

    <b>GIS for regional, city and municipal administrations and urban planning.</b><br>
    <p>Our key directions is to support regional, city and municipal GIS centers.
    We help them in the following directions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>to create GIS infrastructure of the region/city/municipality 
             as a tool (an environment) to attract the investors to the territory;<br>
             GIS infrastructure is not an information only, but the joint space of different 
             rights and regulations of the territory (all the respective geocoordinate 
             descriptions are integrated in the regional/city/municipal information register);</p></li>
      <li><p>to interact with activities of different ministries and 
             organizations which create and register the coordinate descriptions of 
             rights and regulations by on the same territory;</p></li>
      <li><p>to develop GIS as a tool for interaction between population, 
             regional/city/municipal administrations and investors;</p></li>
      <li><p>to facilitate the activity of investors from the 
             preliminary stages of any projects on the respective territory to project, 
             building and exploiting stages;</p></li>

      <li><p>to help to save money using GIS and to get profit for all the 
             participants; GIS is a tool to prevent lot of duplicated expenses and to 
             get additional effects for many participants simultaneously;</p></li>
      <li><p>to prepare specialists</b> which are able to solve the mentioned tasks.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do such an activity everywhere, for example in Komi republic, 
    Nenetsky autonom okrug, Moscow city, Togluatti city etc.</p>
    <p><img src="../images/uchta.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="125"></p>
    <p><i>Reconstruction of geodetic network and space images as

    The register of administrative boundaries in GIS as a part of the 
    regional GIS infrastructure.</i></p></li>
  <li><a name="bm11"></a>
    <b>Laws and regulations for GIS.</b><br>
    <p>GIS will play an important role only if the duties to implement 
    GIS and to use GIS will be included into the system of laws, legal regulations 
    and technical norms. Therefore we try to include the respective part to any GIS 
    project.<br>It includes: 
    <ul type="disc">
    <li><p>the investigation of existing documents and extracting all 
        the requirements in creation and use of map/coordinate descriptions in the 
        concrete area; it is essential to investigate all the relations which touch the 
        spatial data infrastructure of the regions/cities;</p></li>

    <li><p>building the graphs of all the existing relations in this field;</p></li>
    <li><p>analysis of required changes in the existing documents which will be necessary 
        to implement in order to get the maximal effects from GIS;</p></li>
    <li><p>preparation of the draft of regional laws, legal 
        regulations and technical norms and making test projects before the final 
        signing of the documents.</p></li>
    </ul></li>
  <li><a name="bm12"></a>
    <b>GIS for geodesy and cartography.</b><br>
    <p>Our GIS software is used by a set of specialized 
    geodetical and cartographical enterprises for map digitizing and distributing in 
    any formats, for processing of raster images, for preparation maps both for GIS 
    and publishing in traditional and electronic forms.</p></li>

  <li><a name="bm13"></a>
    <b>GIS for election campaigns and political management.</b><br>
    <p>Our GIS software is used for election activities from federal and regional to 
    local levels. It is used for creation of electronic portraits of electoral 
    districts including multiple social-economic and ecological variables, for 
    electoral programs, for the analysis and interpretation results of elections and 
    for forecasting. It is used for the federal level and regional election 
    campaigns since 1995</p>
